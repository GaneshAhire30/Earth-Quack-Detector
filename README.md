# Earth Quack Detector

## Overview
* Based on aspects of building location and construction, your goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.
 

## Problem description
* We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:
1. 1 represents low damage 
2.	2 represents a medium amount of damage 
3. 3 represents almost complete destruction 

## Features

* The dataset mainly consists of information on the buildings' structure and their legal ownership. Each row in the dataset represents a specific building in the region that was hit by Gorkha earthquake.
* There are 39 columns in this dataset, where the building_id column is a unique and random identifier. The remaining 38 features are described in the section below. 
* Categorical variables have been obfuscated random lowercase ascii characters. The appearance of the same character in distinct columns does not imply the same original value.

## Description
1. geo_level_1_id, geo_level_2_id, geo_level_3_id (type: int): geographic region in which building exists, from largest (level 1) to most specific sub-region (level 3). Possible values: level 1: 0-30, level 2: 0-1427, level 3: 0-12567.

21. has_superstructure_rc_non_engineered (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of non-engineered reinforced concrete. 
22. has_superstructure_rc_engineered (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of engineered reinforced concrete. 
23. has_superstructure_other (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the superstructure was made of any other material. 
24.	legal_ownership_status (type: categorical): legal ownership status of the land where building was built. Possible values: a, r, v, w. 
25. count_families (type: int): number of families that live in the building. 
26. has_secondary_use (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the building was used for any secondary purpose. 
27. has_secondary_use_agriculture (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the building was used for agricultural purposes. 
28. has_secondary_use_hotel (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the building was used as a hotel. 
29. has_secondary_use_rental (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the building was used for rental purposes. 
30. has_secondary_use_institution (type: binary): flag variable that indicates if the building was used as a location of any institution.
